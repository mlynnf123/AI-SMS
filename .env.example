# Set to 'true' to use Make.com for SMS conversation handling
# Set to 'false' or leave unset to handle conversations directly in this server
USE_MAKE_WEBHOOK=false

# Note: Supabase credentials are not needed in this file
# When USE_MAKE_WEBHOOK=true, Supabase operations are handled by the Make.com scenario
# The Make.com scenario stores conversations and messages in Supabase

# ===== IMPORTANT FOR GOOGLE CLOUD RUN DEPLOYMENT =====
# For Google Cloud Run deployment, you should set these environment variables
# in the Cloud Run service configuration, not in this file.
# 
# In the Google Cloud Console:
# 1. Go to Cloud Run > Select your service > Edit & Deploy New Revision
# 2. Expand "Container, Networking, Security" section
# 3. Add each environment variable under "Environment variables"
# 
# This approach is more secure than committing actual API keys to your repository.
