# Make.com Blueprint Fixes

## URGENT: Fix for "Automatic failure response" Error

Based on the error message you're receiving, Make.com is getting the Twilio webhook data but failing to process it correctly. Here's how to fix this:

### 1. Update the Webhook Module (Module #62)

The webhook is receiving standard Twilio SMS format with fields like `Body`, `From`, `ToCountry`, etc. Make sure your webhook module is configured to handle this format:

1. Open your Make.com scenario
2. Go to the first module (Gateway: CustomWebHook)
3. Make sure it's configured to accept all incoming data without validation
4. Check if there are any required fields that might be causing the validation to fail

### 2. Fix Data Mapping in Subsequent Modules

The error occurs because modules after the webhook are expecting data in a different format:

1. In module #60 (Supabase: createARow), update the mapping:
   ```
   table: "messages",
   content: "{{62.Body}}",  // This is correct
   phone_number: "{{62.From}}"  // This is correct
   ```

2. Make sure all other modules that reference webhook data use the correct field names:
   - Use `{{62.Body}}` instead of custom field names
   - Use `{{62.From}}` for the phone number
   - Use `{{62.SmsStatus}}` for status information

## Original Fixes (Still Required)

### 3. Fix the HTTP Endpoint URL

In module #61 (HTTP Action), the URL is currently malformed:

```
https://ai-sms-new-730199417968.us-central1.run.appcheck-leads
```

This should be corrected to:

```
https://ai-sms-new-730199417968.us-central1.run.app/check-leads
```

### 4. Fix the Thread ID Handling

In module #5 (OpenAI - Message Assistant Advanced), you're using a hardcoded thread ID with a trailing space:

```
"threadId": "thread_XdRfnBjMXH0J8inOCsR1vMWL "
```

This should be changed to use the thread ID from the conversation record:

```
"threadId": "{{66.thread_id}}"
```

### 5. Update the Router Conditions

The router in module #37 has conditions that may not be evaluating correctly. Make sure the conditions are properly set up to route conversations based on whether they're new or existing.

### 6. Fix the Filter Condition in Module #67

The filter condition in module #67 checks for `{{60.conversation_history}}` which doesn't appear to be set anywhere. Review this condition and update it to use a field that actually exists.

## Testing After Fixes

1. Save the blueprint
2. Enable the scenario
3. Send a test SMS to your Twilio number
4. Check the execution logs in Make.com to see if it processes correctly
5. If it fails, look at which module is failing and why

## Debugging Tips

1. **Add a "Set Variable" Module**: After the webhook module, add a "Set Variable" module to log the incoming data structure
2. **Use "Text Aggregator"**: Add a Text Aggregator module to see the exact structure of the data at each step
3. **Check Supabase Connection**: Ensure your Supabase connection is working correctly
4. **Verify Error Messages**: Look at the specific error messages in the execution history

If you continue to have issues, try creating a simplified version of the scenario with just the webhook and a few essential modules to isolate where the problem is occurring.
