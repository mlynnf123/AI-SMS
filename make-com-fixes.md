# Make.com Blueprint Fixes

To fix the continuous conversation issue in your Make.com blueprint, follow these steps:

## 1. Fix the HTTP Endpoint URL

In module #61 (HTTP Action), the URL is currently malformed:

```
https://ai-sms-new-730199417968.us-central1.run.appcheck-leads
```

This should be corrected to:

```
https://ai-sms-new-730199417968.us-central1.run.app/check-leads
```

Make sure the domain and path are properly separated.

## 2. Fix the Thread ID Handling

In module #5 (OpenAI - Message Assistant Advanced), you're using a hardcoded thread ID with a trailing space:

```
"threadId": "thread_XdRfnBjMXH0J8inOCsR1vMWL "
```

This should be changed to use the thread ID from the conversation record:

```
"threadId": "{{66.thread_id}}"
```

This ensures each conversation uses its own thread ID.

## 3. Update the Router Conditions

The router in module #37 has conditions that may not be evaluating correctly. Make sure the conditions are properly set up to route conversations based on whether they're new or existing.

## 4. Fix the Filter Condition in Module #67

The filter condition in module #67 checks for `{{60.conversation_history}}` which doesn't appear to be set anywhere. Review this condition and update it to use a field that actually exists.

## 5. Test the Flow

After making these changes:

1. Save the blueprint
2. Run a test with a new phone number
3. Send an initial message
4. Reply to the message
5. Verify that the conversation continues

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Add Logging**: Add more logging modules to help debug the flow
2. **Check Supabase Connection**: Ensure your Supabase connection is working correctly
3. **Verify OpenAI Assistant**: Make sure your OpenAI Assistant ID is correct and the assistant is properly configured
4. **Check Twilio Configuration**: Verify that your Twilio phone number is correctly set up to forward incoming SMS to your webhook

## Troubleshooting

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. Check the logs in Make.com for each execution
2. Verify that the data is being correctly passed between modules
3. Check that the conversation records are being properly created in Supabase
4. Ensure that the thread ID is being correctly stored and retrieved
