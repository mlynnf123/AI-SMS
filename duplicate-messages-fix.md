# Fix for Duplicate Messages Issue

Based on your message thread, I can see that you're receiving duplicate messages from your system. This is happening because **both your server and your Make.com scenario are processing and responding to the same incoming SMS**.

## The Problem

When a user sends a message to your Twilio number:

1. Twilio forwards the message to your server's `/sms` endpoint
2. Twilio also forwards the message to your Make.com webhook
3. Both systems process the message and send a response
4. The user receives duplicate messages

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Use Only Make.com (Recommended)

The cleanest solution is to use only one system to handle the conversations. Since you've already set up the Make.com scenario with OpenAI integration:

1. Modify your server's `/sms` route to simply forward messages to Make.com without processing them:

```javascript
// Route to handle incoming SMS - MODIFIED TO ONLY FORWARD TO MAKE.COM
fastify.post('/sms', async (request, reply) => {
    const { Body, From } = request.body;

    try {
        console.log('Received SMS:', { Body, From });
        
        // Forward the SMS data to Make.com webhook without any processing
        await sendToWebhook({
            Body,
            From,
            timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
        });
        
        // Return a success response without sending an SMS
        reply.send({ success: true });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error forwarding SMS to webhook:', error);
        reply.status(500).send({ 
            error: 'Internal server error', 
            message: error.message || 'Unknown error'
        });
    }
});
```

2. Make sure your server is not sending SMS responses directly

### Option 2: Use Only Your Server

Alternatively, you could disable the Make.com scenario and handle everything in your server:

1. Disable the Make.com scenario
2. Update your server to handle the full conversation flow

### Option 3: Set a Flag to Prevent Duplicate Processing

If you want to keep both systems, you can add a flag to prevent duplicate processing:

1. Add a custom header or parameter when forwarding from your server to Make.com
2. In Make.com, check for this flag and only process messages that don't have it

## Implementation Steps for Option 1 (Recommended)

1. Update your server's `/sms` route as shown above
2. Make sure the `USE_MAKE_WEBHOOK` environment variable is set to `true`
3. Remove any direct SMS sending code from your server's `/sms` route
4. Test with a new conversation

## Checking Your Current Configuration

1. Check your `.env` file for the `USE_MAKE_WEBHOOK` setting:
   ```
   USE_MAKE_WEBHOOK=true
   ```

2. Look at your server code to ensure it's not sending SMS responses when `USE_MAKE_WEBHOOK` is true

3. Verify that your Make.com scenario is correctly processing messages and sending responses

## Additional Debugging

If you're still seeing duplicate messages after implementing these changes:

1. Add logging to your server to track when messages are received and processed
2. Add a "Set Variable" module in Make.com to log when it processes messages
3. Check if there are multiple instances of your server running
4. Verify that your Twilio webhook configuration is correct and not sending to multiple endpoints
